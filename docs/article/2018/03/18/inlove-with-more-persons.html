    <p>The question doesn’t take into consideration the practicalities of a polyamorous relationship but just the phenomenon per se. It is clearly difficult to get into a polyamorous relationship because of gealousy, administrative issues, kids, time etc. But I think that answering this question is important for the way we react if this happens to us!</p>

	<summary>
	In the past, I fell in love with someone while being inlove with my partner and felt equal passion for both, though in different ways.
	</summary>
	This could happen because my boyfriend was quite workaholic and had less need for seeing me (once in two weeks was enough for him, while I would have wanted to see him every day and less than once a week was very hard for me) and less desire to spend much time together, except for walks. Nevertheless, I was inlove with him: I liked him so much, he was so sweet, empathtic, tender, sensual, I felt he could understand me, could talk to him about everything, and sex was so great I coudln't wait meeting him. 

	Despite this, after so much distance I started to think about breaking up. I wasn't sure but I took a step back and was open to other people. I had told him I want more, and he was asking me to wait untill he would be less busy.. I know, I should have ended it.. But it's hard for an addict to give up his drug until he finds a better one. And I met another guy, and fell inlove on the spot. I remember, after my first date with the new guy, when I met my boyfriend I felt distanced from him. Yes, probably it wasn't only my new feelings but also the resentment I had towards him because he hadn't been able to give me what I needed, which I considered normal, and also because he couldn't feel my distance and my feelings. 

	However, after this first feeling, I started getting my feelings for him back, also because the new guy gave me the impression he wasn't up for attachment. He was part of a band, and he liked women a lot. He seemed the kind hard to commit to only one. But I gave him a try, because his actions wouldn't really match my gut feeling. He made suggestions about us having a baby. He spent more time with me, he slept after having sex not left as my boyfriend, we cooked together not let me cook alone as my boyfriend. He was very open minded, artsy and hippie and not considering artists loosers as my boyfriend did. But the fullness, perfection, sweetness, selflessness, anyway, the soul connection I had with my boyfriend made me unable to give him up either. I started being inlove with both of them. I was even making love with both of them with the same passion and intensity. This took one month, in which I could not sleep much and I felt I was going crazy.

	Until my boyfriend just confessed that he can't give me what I need, that he will always be a workaholic and maybe we'll get back together sometime, if we don't find someone better.

<p>So in my experience, it is clearly possible to be in love with two persons at the same time.</p>

<p>I don’t know how this could have went on but there are many people in ployamorous relationships (mostly loving two other people) which to me shows this could really be possible, despite general opinion.</p>

<p>But what can neuroscience tell us about this question?
Falling in love ensues euphoria and severe physical reactions, like a beating heart; perspiration and insomnia; emotional dependency; strongly focused attention; an obsessive, possessive, and protective attitude toward the partner; and a feeling of heightened energy.(Swaab) From these, only focused attention is the one which limits the process to be triggered again by another object of desire. 
Falling in love is a process that just happens, as shown by the fact that the regions it activates are all in the areas at the base of the brain, particularly the reward system. Only when the most intense period of infatuation has passed does the prefrontal cortex (involved in deliberation, planning, assesment) take over.
From this description it ensues that it is very hard to fall for someone new when you are in the most intense phase of infatuation, but with time chances become bigger. It is easy to see that if the person you are in love with doesn’t satisfy your rewards system anymore, it will lack reinforcement</p>
